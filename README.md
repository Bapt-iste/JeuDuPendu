# JeuDuPendu / HangmanGame
_Jeu du pendu (Hangman game) in C#_

__ /!\ it's still under development /!\ __

## How it work (or should work)

Choose a word that someone else will have to guess. 

Then, the other person (or yourself if you're alone) has to guess the word. 

Enter a letter and press enter. (more than one will crash the program)

To do : 
  - Ignore the case
  - Verify if the word is succesfully guessed and end the game
  - Put the code in function to do it properly
  - Caught exception when multiple letter are in the buffer
  - Maybe write it all in English
  - Comment more
  
  
 Btw, have a great day !
